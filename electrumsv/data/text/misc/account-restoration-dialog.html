<h2>The Account Restoration window</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Provisional in-wallet help</i></p>
<p>
This window allows the user to search remote restoration archives for activity relating to their
currently selected account. Once activity has been located, the user can opt to import any located
transactions into the given account. It is only recommended that users do this if they have to,
and not just out of idle curiosity as it comes with both risks and limitations.
</p>
<h3>When account restoration is allowed</h3>
<h4>Creating a new account</h4>
<p>
When a user creates a new account by importing pre-existing key information, whether done through
the importing an account from text or hardware wallet options, they will be presented with the
option to restore that account. The account is actually in effect locked until they have
restored it. Visible indications will be provided that accounts in this state are unusable,
and helpful direction provided to aid the user in performing the required restoration.
</p>
<h4>When the user chooses</h4>
<p>
Users can restore an account over and over again, should they have the need to do so.
Most users will never have a need to do this, and will only find tainted transactions by doing so.
</p>
<h3>Valid use</h3>
<p>
The sole valid use for restoring an account is worst case scenario recovery of key usage.
This is not ideal, but it is the sole resource that users have available to them in this situation.
</p>
<h3>Stages of account restoration</h3>
<h4>Transaction discovery</h4>
<p>
The first stage is searching for use of the current account's keys in the restoration archive. This
will show progress in the form of noting how many transactions have been found and how long has been
spent looking. When all keys have been searched, the restorer will have a record of where they
were used ready for the import stage.
</p>
<h5>Limitations</h5>
<p>
The account restoration functionality is not intended to fix any conflicts that may exist.
If restoration locates any conflicting transactions, the import process will be disabled. This
should not occur, and if it does occur it is possibly because of unexpected circumstances.
</p>
<h5>Advanced options</h5>
<p>
Only deterministic accounts have advanced options at this time. Imported address, public key and
private key accounts do not, and the button will be disabled.
</p>
<h4>Transaction import</h4>
<p>
The second stage is importing the transactions that were found to be using the account's keys.
While this can be interrupted at any stage, that will only stop additional transactions from being
imported. It will not remove transactions that have already been imported, those transactions
should be disassociated from the account manually.
</p>
<h3>Possible dangers</h3>
<h4>Data loss</h4>
<p>
The blockchain information which enables keys to be linked to transactions that may have been
published to it, is very limited. All it locates is the raw transactions. No context, no metadata.
This is as stated, a worst case scenario approach to recovery of account contents. Any information
the previous wallet had on the transactions and the accounts it includes in general, cannot be
recovered at this time.
</p>
<h4>Tainted transactions</h4>
<p>
A user should only accept payments that they know the source of. The danger with including
mystery transactions found on the blockchain into the user's account, is that these transactions
may be tainted in one of several possible ways.
<ul>
    <li>They may have been sent to the user with the goal of tracking any payments or blockchain
        interactions the user makes, when the user claims the funds and spends them.</li>
    <li>Deranged users are known to post illegal material to the blockchain so that they can
        claim that the blockchain or the users who receive it are complicit.</li>
</ul>
For these reasons it is strongly recommended that users be very careful about which payments
they incorporate into their account.
